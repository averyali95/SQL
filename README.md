HOTEL DATA stakeholder requests
1. Is our hotel revenue growing YoY? 
2. Should we increase our parking lot size?
	Is there a trend with personal car usage?
3. What trends can we see in the data?
	Focus on Average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality

KEY FINDINGS:

Hotel Revenue is growing YOY, 2020 data cannot be used due to the incompleteness of the dataset. Based on 2018 - 2019 YoY revenue has increased drastically for both the resorts and
City hotels.

BASED ON total bookings mid year, Q3 into Q4 is when the most bookings occur. Most likely due to sumemr vacations and Q4 holiday time. 
This info is taken from 2018 and 2019 as the 2020 data set is not fully complete for the year. It is only inlcudes Jan - August which might skew the data.

Based on visualization of car data, there is no need to build more parking. At any given time, there is no more than 4% total parking utilization amongst all hotels.
